## Working definition of Git and what it's done for

Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in code during development of software.

## What do you think the top 3 reasons to use GitHub / GitLab are?
1. It is a good way to publicly have your code and your coding process shown for recruiters.
2. It is an easy way to contribute to projects with a group.
3. Documentation of the changes that the code went through to get to where it is now.

## What is a Pull Request?

A pull request is basically a request to make your commits a part of the project.  The pull request contains the changes you want to make and it can be discussed, reviewed, and even altered before being accepted or rejected.
